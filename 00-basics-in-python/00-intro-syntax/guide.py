# Hey! Hi and Welcome to Python. I am a Code Comment, I always come up with '#' in the starting of line. I help you to describe the code and what it does in a syntax free context and sometimes to make some parts of your code to lose effect without deleting it. That's simple intro about me we will catch up later! around the course.

print("So, Hi! I am the print method from the Python Language. I am pretty we are going to be very much inseparable in certain points. My purpose of being in this very simple and easy to learn Python Programming language is to serve you the data or info you need to log in the terminal after getting the result from your machine")
print("More about me!üòÖ would be very tiring right now! So, I will stop by this! As of final note you can use me various kinds of purposes, that you will explore in the future! Right then Bye üëãüèø")

print("So! Hi from the Input method" + 
input("Hey! Hi Unlike the Print Statement I am the one person who will be used to ask the questions or accepting values from the user for further processing of data. So when get to see me! you may need to say your name?")
)

print("üßëüèø‚Äçüè´ Hey Hi now you have started to execute some python code already! let's dig much deeper in this by learning one of the most important concepts of every programming language like Python")

print('So, Hi once again! I am the print Method we already know each other right! Fine, Before getting more about Python Programming concepts we just get start with one simple definition, donot get scared! I promise it wouldnot be too hard.')
print('Python is a high level, object-oriented, interpreted programming language. hold on a second, what exactly all these means?ü´∏üèø')
print('So, back in the days programming is more physical which made the processing of data sent to the computer respond with them, but later days it started to have a human understandable context with several reserved keywords that the system can understand. Later days it has made the job of instructing the computer very handier. Which is the result of the arrival of different programming languages like C, C++, Java, Python etc... So these languages can able to take simple keyword information and the system will take care of the machine or assembly level code execution for us. This is known as High level languages pretty simple right!')
print('So, lets take me the print method as an example I do already said that I print things to the terminal for you! Like I was named as print for your convenience and the thing I do is made as a instruction on the Python at its whole.')
print('If you need me to do some stuff with your machine all you need is your machine should have Python binaries , in simple words, Python in your machine which is going to get used by the machine to let what I [print] to do!')
print("There is various methods you can get Python in your machine. Explore that using simply googling it around")

print('Coming back to the definition, we have seen what does High Level Language implying us, so what are the other 2 pieces of our definition.')
print('Object-Oriented a new one right! may be too difficult to understand it, but actually not!üòÅ So Object-Oriented programming, lets just break this down‚õìÔ∏è‚Äçüí•')
print('OBJECT - ORIENTED - PROGRAMMING, In programming what we all do most of the time is acquiring answers, solving problems [business and technical], making calculations and so much more. But at the end we are going to utilize the advantage of any programming language and right some instructions which is going to be made for doing something into the computer. Like I said we all are going to write the instructions, but here comes the question. how I should write the instruction using Python it is fineüòÇ, But the question is how we are going to approach the instruction.?????')
print('Fine lets take an example that explains what is Object Oriented Programming really does?')
print('So, consider you are going to buy a mobile from a Mobile Shop!')
print('Here you are asked for some X brand XYZ model mobile phone to the seller')
print("And he gets the cellphone right from the rack where it is kept for display or something")
print("And you pay the bill and getting out of the shop very happily using your mobile phone")
print('Hold on!... What is really the relation between this with Object - Oriented...')
print('okay! fine let me say something... If I say the same bunch of things which was mentioned in earlier, in the following way...')
print('You have seen an advertisement in the Television which was bought by your Parents and you used to watch that every evening, on that time you have spotted a highly flashing mobile of Brand X model XYZ. You really liked that mobile phone and you started to dream that you have that mobile with you and using it for some random stuff!, waking up of the dream you realize it has cost a 5 digit figure. You knew that it is going to take me time to buy this, and you started saving some money to buy that phone and after some point you got some money at your hand and decided to reach the mobile shop.')
print("You put fuel to your vehicle in the petrol bunk and arrived the Mobile Shop and asked for that mobile X and you forgot the model number and you are trying to figure it out by saying whatever this comes in your mind about the physical features like color, design and finally the salesperson brought you the brochure and you finally get the Model number and said the salesperson this is the one!")
print("And the salesperson got that model's last piece left in their store and described the features and pricing discounts of that for that model and explained everything for about an hour! Finally You bought the phone and feel overwhelmed of the things you have gone through to buy this and you left the shop with happiness.")
print('.................. !oh...! you can see the difference between these 2 same actions. the way we describe things we very much important in all the instances... So! In programming too we need to very much concerned about the way we do things, here in this example the action is you want to buy a mobile phone of brand x model xyz. This action is described like the above mentioned 2 ways being the same action but different approach. this way we can describe the action of one person but not people who may have a similar stories for buying their mobilephone')
print("There comes the Object - Oriented thing, So in Object - Orinted programming we can set a blueprint things we are intend to do with things we have and things we do?")
print('So, in programming Object-Orientation is like having a basic structure like what can something has/have and do/does? along with some really cool things to have like abstraction, polymorphism, inheritance and so on')
print('Understanding programming also have a major part of the useful guidelines framework writing neat code.')
print('Finally we can move on to the next part of definition that is Interpreter language. According to Wikipedia, In computing, an interpreter is software that directly executes encoded logic. Use of an interpreter contrasts the direct execution of CPU-native executable code that typically involves compiling source code to machine code.')
print('Interpreter is simply a piece of software that acts as orator of our program that says what the program says from execution in the machine. So, in general there will be source code of some language being converted to machine level code for further execution.')

print("Yeah! it is quite a high level definition of Python Programming Language, but python can be used in various number of fields and operations like scripting, mathematical analysis, web development, software development etc....")

print('With that much we gone through about Python, here we can exploring some more members of the Python language itself.')
print('So, anywhere in programming we got to work with data or just information. Before get to know much about this I would like introduce you to some data related terminologies such DS [Data Structures], Variables, Constants, Addresses and lastly Memory Pool')

# Hey! Hi then I am back the comment block. I just simply want to say you something about the following definitions, if you face anything overwhelmed you can simply stop by there and move on from this topic, because it is going to be advance level definition, but don't worry once you get a basic grasp of what it will be understandable as you go along with the course. So, feel to free to skip these definitions you are going to face now. the reason for putting this definition here is to make you understand there is no way like linear path of learning anything, including programming. The one thing you will get to learn is just nothing to learn and use that information you got to build something on your own.
print('Data Structures are the organization of data or information in a very much efficient and accesible way.')
print('Variables are like a named container having stored with some data into it and can possibly for various purposes.')
print('Constants are also storage containers for values that remains immutable or non-changeable. Python doesnot have built-in syntax for constant declarations')
print('Memory Pool in Python, a fundamental component of the memory management system designed to efficiently handle small objects (up to 512 bytes) by minimizing memory fragmentation and improving allocation speed.')

print('Time to Do things on our own and to start writing some really code... Using a Code-Editor like VS code, Pycharm, Sublime, Notepad++ etc...')
print('Before starting to write any of the python code in your system verify whether you have a stable build of Python3 and Code editor setted up.')

print('Once you got all the things setted up! go to the `main.py` file in the current folder.')
print('If you are using some modern-code-editors application try to Open the Integrated terminal and navigate to the current folder by using the following command')

# cd 00-intro-syntax 
# python --version
# üßëüèø‚Äçüè´ If you are using VS code use the following command for opening the current working directory as your project.
# code .
# Use the print method to say `Hello Everyone!`.
# And try print some more lines till you get the Grasp about the fundamentals of running a python code.

# From here I will be signing off from the Guide file.
