## JOKE'S API - APPLICATION

Here in this exercise we are going to explore.

1. FastAPI - Introduction.
1. Use Case of API.
1. Using the Httpie or Postman API testing Services.
1. Jokes API Documentation.
1. Application with HTML Forms to make get request to the server.
1. And use the data to show really nice UI applications.

### Prequisties

- Python and PIP package manager for Python projects
- Modern browsers [chromium, firefox]
- Basic Grasp of HTML CSS JS Fetch API and Python programming

### Setting up the Project

- So, we have to make sure that we have Python 3.8+ being installed in our local system.
- Since we need some third-party packages need to be installed to run our application we need to set up a virtual environment.
- It is because we don't want install all these packages globally to get used to every applications we are going to build also it is a recommended step because it will be containing all the recommended packages for the project in isolation and can be able to share them with your peers.
- So, generally we can have various number of packages need to be installed for the application to run, it is highly recommened to have this step done properly.
- On according to run the application in your local machine. Follow the steps mentioned below.

1. Make sure to install the Python Interpreter 3.10 or greater.
1. Now get the Integrated terminal for the current project opened within in the VS code. using **ctrl + shft + `** or **ctrl + J**.
1. Start running the Virtual Environment Come up with the project, the folder named as **venv**

#### In Windows PowerShell

```
cd venv/Scripts
activate.ps1
```

#### In Windows Cmd

```
cd venv/Scripts
activate.bat
```

#### In Bash

```
source venv/Scripts/activate
```

1. Once the Virtual Environment is enabled, it means all the dependencies for the application to run is ready already. So, there is one more file called the **requirements.txt** which is used for installing the application.

1. Run the API using this command `fastapi dev main.py`.

### Getting Started

- For running the Application you need to install Python version 3.8+.
- This application is tested on 3.13.5 and it is good to get install Python Stable build at the point when you running the program.
- Make sure you have **pip** or **Pip installs packages**. It is weird but ðŸ˜… it is the full form it.
- Use the HTML 5, CSS 3 and JS code for writing the frontend of the Jokes APP.
- Make sure you have installed the packages for the front-end or browser-side rendering the application.
- Sure you have the basics of Python Already know.
- Here we can learn more about Template Engines.
- In this Tutorial we are building the Frontend using HTML CSS JS stack along with Python at the Backend.
